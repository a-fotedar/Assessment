# Task 1: dogs.ceo
Tool used: SoapUI - Open Source (Rest Project)

Project contains 3 API Calls to dogs.ceo and one Test Suite with one Test Case and 3 Test steps.
Test Step 1 is the only Test that contains an assertion and to view the details (or the script for the assertion) you will be required to go into the Test Step to view by double-clicking on the TestStep (Namely "ListAll"). The other two are only API Calls.

Steps To Use: 
- Download SoapUI (Open Source Version) and install.
- Open SoapUI once installation is completed
- Import the ABSA Assessment Task 1.xml file into SoapUI. (Alternately, You may extract the .xml file from the Zip Folder and import that into SoapUI. Both are the same).
